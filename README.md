# IPL Insights with RAG & LlamaIndex üèèüß† 
### Turning Cricket Commentary into Actionable Intelligence
### Overview
This project demonstrates a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using LlamaIndex to extract meaningful insights from IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket commentary. Imagine being able to ask natural language questions about specific match events, player performance, or tactical decisions, and getting precise, contextually relevant answers directly from the commentary data.

### Why IPL Commentary & RAG?
IPL commentary is a rich, dynamic, and often informal source of information. It contains:

- Play-by-play descriptions: Who scored, who bowled, wickets, boundaries.
- Player Analysis:Analysis of batsman and bowler for example how to get batsman out in different phases of the game etc.

Traditional search struggles with the nuances of natural language and contextual understanding in commentary. RAG, with its ability to retrieve relevant snippets before generating an answer, is perfectly suited for:

- Reducing hallucinations: Answers are grounded in actual commentary.
- Providing specific details: Retrieve exact phrases or sentences from the commentary.
- Handling evolving information: Easily update the knowledge base with new match commentary.
- Enhancing user experience: Users can ask questions in a natural, conversational manner.
